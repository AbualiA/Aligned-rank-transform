# Aligned-rank-transform
Aligned Rank Transform with Matlab

This function is written to do aligned rank transform using matlab

for a data with heavy tail, this function could be used for getting the aligned rank transformed data and implementing Analysis of variance and mixed effect models
This is an approach used when the data has non-normal distribution
